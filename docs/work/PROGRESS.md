# Forge Work Progress

This file is persistent engineering memory for long-running AI-assisted work.
Keep it concise and factual. Do not use it as a release note or marketing log.

## Current branch / PR

- Branch: `feat/multiphysics-lifecycle-foundation`
- PR: #102 — P0: restore automatic assurance gates
- Base: `main`
- Strategic contract: `docs/project/FORGE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

## Completed in this line of work

- Added the persistent Forge Master Plan as the long-term project operating
  contract, including session recovery, roadmap precedence, solver/provider
  strategy, data policy, Time/Environment/Lifecycle pillars and flagship systems.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` so every new agent/session reads the Master Plan before
  selecting work, and removed the obsolete manual-only CI policy.
- Reframed `ACTIVE_PLAN.md` around P0 assurance stabilization followed by
  Time, Environment and Lifecycle foundations.
- Restored automatic Tests and hardened-core recertification workflows on pull
  requests, retained manual fallback, made V4 mutation shards explicit
  certification prerequisites, fixed the assurance-builder CLI invocation and
  completed the declared Docker test/benchmark dependency set.
- Automatic workflow runs were triggered on PR #102 after these changes.
  Their final scientific/test result must be read from GitHub Actions before
  any PASS/green claim is made.

- Added deterministic hierarchical system/component topology bound to existing
  `ScientificTwin`, `PortDefinition`, `PhysicsGraph` and `CouplingEdge`
  authorities. Structural topology is bound through authorized execution;
  unconsumed parameter/state/constraint bindings fail closed.
- Routed window-aligned STEP scenario inputs through the live multiphysics
  runtime without reinitializing participant state; consumed values are
  receipted per window. Unsupported interpolation/features and schedule-less
  replay fail closed.
- Added immutable, unit-bearing, digestible generic scenario contracts with
  strict timeline, state, interpolation and wire-shape validation.
- Added additive GraphPlan v3 scenario binding. Authorized execution currently
  accepts timing-only scenarios and fail-closed refuses every material
  scenario field until runtime consumption and receipts are implemented.
- Removed battery/electrical/thermal realization and solver imports from
  `planning.production`; enabled validated Domain Packs are now the sole
  production source for these artifacts, with existing fail-closed identity
  collision checks retained.

- Extracted credibility/V&V implementation from MCP transport into
  `engcore.credibility`.
- Removed the `claims -> mcp` implementation dependency.
- Added compatibility shims for old MCP credibility imports.
- Grouped claim analysis, governance, replay and NL adapter implementations
  under subpackages while preserving old import identity.
- Added a current architecture entry point and historical-audit index.
- Added persistent Claude/agent working contract, scientific reviewer,
  regression manifest and fast changed-file gate.
- Added trust-registry change detection to impact analysis.
- Strengthened replay bundles with source/runtime environment fingerprints.
- Renamed sprint-phase claim tests by scientific feature.
- Added `tools/forge_impact.py` for dependency and reassessment queries.
- Added the Scientific Diagnostic Engine: blocking-cause classification, explicit assumption registry, model-data discrepancy diagnostics, corrective actions and sensitivity-ranked repair hypotheses.
- Added `tools/forge_diagnose.py`; diagnostics remain derived/non-authoritative and cannot alter verdicts.
- Hardened diagnostics: raw assessments are re-derived before diagnosis; custom-trust assessments require replay bundles; sensitivity/robustness artifacts are sealed and bound to assessment/plan/capability identity.
- Hardened impact drift: current oracle trust/digest changes and removed policy profiles now trigger reassessment.
- Strengthened replay source identity with tracked-diff and untracked-content digests.

commit: 9143516e (working tree changes)

Status: targeted changed-area tests pass; the repository changed-file gate is
blocked by duplicate test-module basename collection errors recorded above.

Environment note (2026-09-19): attempts to access the branch from the
assistant's local execution container were blocked before checkout because that
container could not resolve `github.com`. The latest hardening verification attempt
ran `git clone ... && python -m compileall -q src tools tests`, but clone failed first
with `Could not resolve host: github.com`; therefore compileall and pytest did not run.
This is not a test result and the status remains NOT RUN.

When a command is executed, append entries in this exact shape:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ
command: <exact command>
result: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED
summary: <counts or first relevant failures>
commit: <sha>
```

Never convert NOT RUN into PASS based on code inspection.

commit: f61a40a8 (working tree changes)

Scientific review milestone: the first scheduled-event review returned CHANGES
REQUIRED because requested controls were stored under `final_outputs`, where
they could be mistaken for calculated results. The corrected design uses
dedicated typed requested/reached synchronization records, exact boundary
indices and the authorized scenario digest; the read-only reviewer then
returned PASS. Neither review executed tests or constitutes validation.

result: PASS
summary: 135 tests passed after adding fail-closed rejection for unknown state owners and dimensionally incompatible state uncertainty; diff whitespace validation passed
commit: 374c709f (working tree changes)

Scientific review milestone: the read-only `forge-scientific-review` reviewer
returned PASS for the corrected initial-state slice. The review did not execute
tests and is not a validation result. The accepted design requires a declared
participant state schema, exact values with existing uncertainty records, a
participant-produced receipt, dedicated run-record provenance, applicability
evaluation and fail-closed replay.

- Rejected an optional `initialize_state` callback that inferred state support
  from callback presence and let the runtime synthesize its own receipt. A
  no-op callback could acknowledge a requested state without installing it.
  The uncommitted implementation was removed. The next design must include a
  participant-declared state schema, state uncertainty, a typed participant
  acknowledgement/resulting-state identity, applicability evaluation, and a
  dedicated run-record receipt before initial state may enter authorization.

Record failed experiments here with the reason they failed before trying a new
approach. Do not delete old failed approaches merely because a later approach
works.

## Open structural follow-ups

- Manually run `python tools/forge_check.py --changed` on PR #65.
- Run FAST and SCIENTIFIC tiers before merge.
- Split the still-large `mcp/problem.py` in a separate structural slice.
- Continue reducing the remaining flat claim modules only after PR #65 is
  verified.
- Do not expand the frozen Scientific Core for repository-layout aesthetics.
